# customSwiftControls

###BubbleSegementedControl
Creates a Custom Segmented Control with colored "bubbles" or "circles".  

Usage is simply to set the items array which is expecting a UIColor(): "BubbleSgementControl.items = [UIColor.greenColor(), UIColor.yellowColor(), UIColor.redColor()]"


###UnderlineSegementedControl
Creates a Custom Segmented Control with Labels that are "Underlined" when selected. currently the labels are black with a black underline.  I will update the control so that can be customized outside of the component but for now one can just update that manually. 

Usage is simply to set the items array which is expecting a String()
